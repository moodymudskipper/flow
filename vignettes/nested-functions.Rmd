```

Many times a function will contain another function definition, these will
not always be very readable in the body of the main function. *{flow}* offers
a way to visualize those.

When using flow on the main function, a message will signify what nested functions
can be viewed. The base function `bquote` is a good example.

```{r}
library(flow)
flow_view(bquote)
```

We can then inspect those by using the `nested_fun` argument, with a numeric id
or a name (if unambiguous)

```{r}
flow_view(bquote, nested_fun = "unquote")

flow_view(bquote, nested_fun = 3)
```
